### Featured Projects in this repository
- ðŸ”— [**Machine Learning**](https://github.com/LaisColetta/Machine-Learning)
  Project 1: Debate Audio Analysis
Analyzed the 2024 U.S. Presidential Debate (Trump & Harris) using pre-trained ML models for speaker diarization, speech-to-text, sentiment analysis, and speech pattern evaluation. The project compares diarization and speech-to-text models and applies LLMs for deeper insights.
  Project 2: Seal Call Classification
Developed a CNN-based model to classify seal calls using spectrograms. The pipeline includes audio preprocessing, spectrogram generation, data augmentation, and model training, with experiments on EfficientNetB4 and ResNet50 for transfer learning.

- ðŸ”—[**Applied Statistics**](https://github.com/LaisColetta/Applied-Statistics)
  This repository contains applied statistics methods, including t-tests and ANOVA, implemented in Python on real-life datasets, providing hands-on analysis and practical applications of statistical concepts.
  
- ðŸ”—[**My Food Canvas**](https://github.com/LaisColetta/My-Food-Canvas)
  This repository contains a web application for managing recipes, allowing users to add, view, update, delete, and search for recipes both locally and online via the Edamam API. Built with Flask, MySQL, and JavaScript, it provides a user-friendly interface for recipe management and uses a RESTful API for programmatic access.

- ðŸ”—[**Programming for Data Analysis**]([https://github.com/LaisColetta/My-Food-Canvas](https://github.com/LaisColetta/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-))
  This project analyzes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset using machine learning classifiers to evaluate and compare their performance in predicting cancer outcomes.
  
- ðŸ”—[**Programming for Data Analysis 2**](https://github.com/LaisColetta/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-2)
- This project analyzes the Wine Quality dataset from Kaggle, exploring the correlation between physicochemical properties and wine quality, fitting probability distributions, and applying statistical and machine learning techniques to draw insights from the data.
